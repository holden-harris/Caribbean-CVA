# Caribbean CVA â€“ Species Distribution Map Generation

This script generates species distribution maps for all shapefiles in the `./data/species-distribution-shapefiles/` directory and saves them as PNG images to `./outputs/disbribution-maps/`.  
It was developed for the **Caribbean CVA** project by *Harris Analytics and Research LLC* in collaboration with *Isla Mar*.

The maps show the geographic distribution polygons for each species overlaid on a Caribbean basemap, cropped to a defined bounding box.  
They are also available in the repository: [outputs/disbribution-maps](https://github.com/holden-harris/Caribbean-CVA/tree/main/outputs/disbribution-maps).
