| Abbreviation | Full Variable Name                    | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bs**       | Bottom Salinity                       | Mean salinity (salt concentration) near the seafloor. Important for benthic organisms sensitive to freshwater inputs or stratification. |
| **bt**       | Bottom Temperature                    | Mean temperature near the seafloor, influencing demersal fish and benthic invertebrates.                                                |
| **chl**      | Chlorophyll-a Concentration           | A proxy for phytoplankton biomass, indicating primary productivity and food availability at the base of the food web.                   |
| **mld**      | Mixed Layer Depth                     | Depth of the upper, well-mixed surface ocean layer, affecting nutrient availability, light, and stratification.                         |
| **msstg**    | Mean Sea Surface Temperature Gradient | Spatial temperature gradient at the surface; an indicator of thermal fronts, ocean circulation, and habitat boundaries.                 |
| **o200**     | Oxygen at 200 m                       | Dissolved oxygen concentration at \~200 meters depth; reflects mid-water oxygen availability and deoxygenation trends.                  |
| **ph**       | Surface pH                            | Measure of ocean acidity (linked to COâ‚‚ uptake and ocean acidification). Lower values = more acidic.                                    |
| **pp**       | Primary Production                    | Gross primary productivity of phytoplankton; determines energy input to marine food webs.                                               |
| **precip**   | Precipitation                         | Rainfall over the ocean, relevant for freshwater input, stratification, and coastal salinity changes.                                   |
| **sso**      | Sea Surface Oxygen                    | Dissolved oxygen concentration at the surface, important for respiration of pelagic species.                                            |
| **sss**      | Sea Surface Salinity                  | Surface salt concentration, reflecting freshwater input, evaporation, and circulation.                                                  |
| **sst**      | Sea Surface Temperature               | Temperature of the upper ocean, widely used as a climate indicator and driver of species distributions.                                 |
| **swsm**     | Surface Wind Speed Magnitude          | Intensity of winds at the ocean surface, a driver of mixing, upwelling, and surface currents.                                           |
