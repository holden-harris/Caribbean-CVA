# Query FishBase Environmental and Trait Data
This script automates the extraction of species-level traits and environmental attributes from [FishBase](https://www.fishbase.org) using the [`rfishbase`](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase) R package as part of the **Caribbean Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA)** led by Isla Mar and Harris Analytics & Research LLC.

## ðŸ“¥ Input
The script expects a CSV file named `species-list.csv` in the working directory. It must contain scientific names.
